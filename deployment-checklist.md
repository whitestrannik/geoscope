# GeoScope Deployment Checklist

## Current Status ✅ MAJOR PROGRESS!
✅ **Dependencies**: Installed (with peer dependency warnings)
✅ **Prisma Client**: Generated successfully 
✅ **Frontend Build**: **SUCCESS!** TypeScript + Vite build working
✅ **TypeScript Errors**: All source code errors fixed
⚠️ **Shared Package**: TypeScript build still failing (system issue)
❌ **Database Setup**: Need environment variables and database connection
⚠️ **Linting**: Some issues remain but not blocking
❌ **Testing**: Memory issues in test runner

## Issues Fixed ✅
1. ✅ Unused imports in backend files (guessRouter.ts, leaderboardRouter.ts)
2. ✅ Unused variables in frontend components
3. ✅ TypeScript parameter issues
4. ✅ Peer dependency version mismatches partially addressed
5. ✅ **Prisma Client**: Generated successfully with `npx prisma generate`
6. ✅ **Frontend Build**: Fixed final unused imports in RoomPage.tsx and StatsPage.tsx
7. ✅ **Vite Build**: Successfully building frontend (1.6MB bundle, 446KB gzipped)

## Critical Issues Remaining

### 1. Database Setup ⚠️ URGENT
- Need `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL`
- Database schema needs to be pushed/migrated
- **Commands needed**:
  ```bash
  # Set DATABASE_URL in .env file first
  cd apps/backend
  npx prisma db push  # or prisma migrate dev
  ```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
Required for deployment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Authentication
- `MAPILLARY_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Image API
- `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `VITE_BACKEND_URL`

### 3. Shared Package Build Issue (Non-blocking)
- TypeScript binary still not found in shared package
- **Workaround**: Frontend builds fine independently
- **Fix**: May need to reinstall TypeScript globally or fix pnpm linking

### 4. Memory Issues in Tests
- JavaScript heap out of memory errors in test runner
- **Fix**: Need to configure Node.js with more memory or optimize tests

## Build Status Summary 📊

| Component | TypeScript | Build | Status |
|-----------|------------|-------|--------|
| Frontend | ✅ Pass | ✅ Success | **READY** |
| Backend | ✅ Pass | ⚠️ Prisma OK | **NEEDS DB** |
| Shared | ❌ System Issue | ⚠️ Skip | **NON-BLOCKING** |

## Deployment Requirements (Phase 6 from tasks-breakdown.md)

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up Railway hosting for backend
- [ ] Set up Vercel/Railway for frontend ✅ (Vite build working)
- [ ] Configure environment variables:
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (Railway PostgreSQL)
  - [ ] `SUPABASE_URL`
  - [ ] `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
  - [ ] `MAPILLARY_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - [ ] JWT secret

### Build Process
- [x] Fix Prisma client generation
- [x] **Fix frontend TypeScript build** ✅
- [x] **Fix frontend Vite build** ✅
- [ ] Set up database connection
- [ ] Test backend startup
- [ ] Resolve remaining linting warnings
- [ ] Fix test memory issues (optional)

### Deployment Files Ready ✅
- [x] Railway configuration (railway.toml)
- [x] Vercel configuration (vercel.json)
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [ ] Production environment configuration
- [ ] Database migration setup

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **✅ COMPLETED**: Fixed all TypeScript build errors
2. **✅ COMPLETED**: Frontend build working perfectly
3. **🔴 URGENT**: Set up database connection and push schema
4. **🟡 READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**: Frontend can be deployed to Vercel immediately
5. **🟡 READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**: Backend ready once database is connected
6. **Create GitHub Actions** - CI/CD workflow
7. **Test end-to-end deployment**

## Commands to Deploy RIGHT NOW! 🚀

### Frontend Deployment (Ready!)
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel (frontend ready!)
npx vercel --prod
# Uses vercel.json config automatically
```

### Backend Deployment (After DB setup)
```bash
# 1. First: Create .env file with DATABASE_URL
# 2. Push database schema
cd apps/backend
npx prisma db push

# 3. Deploy to Railway
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### Database Setup (Next step)
```bash
# For Railway PostgreSQL
railway add postgresql

# Get DATABASE_URL from Railway dashboard
# Add to .env file and push schema
```

**STATUS: Ready for deployment! Frontend builds successfully, just need database setup for backend.** 🎯
